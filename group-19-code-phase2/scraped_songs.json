I got it, I'll take us whereverI'm a staple in the game, all my papers togetherAnd my life is on display like TrumanThey wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em soonerMy exes made some of my favorite musicI dated women from my favorite moviesKarma's such a thing of beautyI'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe itIt's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred metersI keep it a hundred like I'm running a feverI might take a breather but I won't ever leave youIf I was you, I wouldn't like me eitherYeah",

Do the scars really heal up?From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the sideHe seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyesTo see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside Even let him get the last mealHe done with the streets after this, this his last kill He gotta show him that it's that realHe ran up on him with the pipe like, \"****, stand still\" \"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry\" \"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ\"He said, \"Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ\"Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light Tell me if you know someone that needs Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitorBack from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda?

        "lyrics": "Hello, I’m Harry Styles, and tonight I’m going to help you drift off to sleep with some soothing words and calming music. A sleep story just for you. With all the business of your day, I know how hard it can be to go to sleep. So, thank you for choosing this story, and me, to help you. I wish you a wonderful night sleep. So make yourself comfortable, take a deep breath in, and then out. In, and then out. And when you’re ready, close your eyesHave you ever wondered what happens when you sleep, where you go and what you feel; the places that you seek? When you start to drift away, your mind becomes a book that writes itself, then fades away before you wake to lookTonight we’re going to think about anything you’d like. So, first let’s visualize some scenes to see us through the night. Settle back and clear your mind. We’re heading somewhere special, beyond the world of consciousness, to places more celestialI’d like you to imagine now you’re there beneath the stars. Which, when you pause to think about it, actually you are. As you focus on the darkness right before your eyes, feel the scenes with glinting lights to emulate night skiesThink about the things you cherish most and those you love, and then allow yourself to be embraced from up above. The power of the universe meanders through your mind. So, come with me and let’s see what the two of us can findLet’s travel now to moonlit valleys blanketed with heather; the kind of landscape you and I could dream about forever. Imagine lazing on the ground, succumbing to the charms of blades of grass we now caress with fingertips and palmsA gentle scent of cedar wood is floating on the breeze; a gift from mother nature and her nearby cedar trees. We’re gazing on the night sky now, marveling at infinity. So, allow your mind to wander to a peaceful, new vicinityPicture this: a rich green forest damp with morning dew. Inhale the morning air as we explore, just me and you. Leaves create mosaics in every shade of green, as gentle birdsong mingles with the babbling of a streamDappled sepia sunlight cuts through branches of ahead, as dew drops fall from leaf to leaf, like glistening strands of thread. The dew drops finally coalesce forming satin beads. Occasionally they kiss our cheeks. Small pleasures; quenching needsHolding hands, we stroll, until we chance upon a brook. Its cool, clear water mirroring our faces as we look. A shimmering reflection shows us smiling from above. The world we think but dare not speak, is L-O-V-E; loveNow, we snuggle on a raft and drift for endless hours. As willow trees sway in the breeze and blossoms fall in showers. Gently swaying to and fro, we look up at the sky and watch the clouds above us forming shapes as they pass byThe wisps of cloud swirl slowly, tinged with tangerine and pink, and as they fade, the sunset give us cause to muse and think of places we should visit and the oceans we could cross. For some who wander through this world, there’s grace in being lostPassing by a waterfall, our thoughts sway to and fro, and time begins to fade and blur beneath the moon’s pale glow. A symphony of tumbling water, lulls and mesmerizes. Nature’s soundtracks to our dreams assumes so many geysersStrolling on a sidewalk now, as rain begins to fall. Its gentle pitter-patter holds us deep within its thrall. The raindrops rhythm briefly slows, then intensifies. Peaceful and benevolent; a gift from moonlit skiesThe fragrance the rain creates upon the concrete surface inspires, yet relaxes us and focuses our purpose to shift our minds to neutral and allow our thoughts to drift and recognize the rainfall as a mesmerizing giftSheltering beneath the porch, we watch the rain pour down. But, now the time has come to leave this dreamy moonlit town. A gentle breeze wafts through the trees, and causes leaves to stir, and then the rain relents and fades as time begins to blurWe find ourselves upon a shoreline, lounging by a lake. All crickets chirp in nearby reeds, it’s hard to stay awake. The scene feels like a watercolor; soft, diluted tones. As looking down we see each other laughing, skimming stonesThe stones skip on the gleaming lake and ripples start to form, and though the sun has dipped from view, we feel content and warm. Herons drift on thermals, high above the sun-bleached pier, and in the trees beyond the lake, we glimpse a passing deerStrands of cloud unfurl like ribbons in the orange sky. Mirrored on the lake now, like a painted butterfly. In the distance, mountains beckon, capped with pristine snow. The kind of sight that dreams evoke when hearts and minds let go",

Widziałem w tym glorię, nie zbrodnięGdy byłem dzieciakiem, nieraz na dywanie, wjeżdżałem we wroga czołgiemBo nie wiedziałem, że jeden człowiek, to tyle planów, marzeń, wspomnień...Jako nastolatek, bawiłem się w wojnę, z paroma rówieśnikami, a drewniany karabin, z niekończącymi się nabojami, nie ranił nas...Jako nastolatek robiłem zasieki z gałęzi, a nieśmiertelniki to były rzemyki na piersiJak posyłaliśmy pociski do siebie seriami, nie było agresji tam...Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta! Nie było łez i ran...Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta! Nie było śmierci tam...Ta! Ta! Ta! Ta!Dziś, kiedy dorosłem, to miewam sen o tym, że otwieram oczyW pokoju, na łóżku i nie mam sufitu...  Pod niebem niebieskich ciał...Po huku ciężkich dział :Czasami o tym, a czasem o tamtym... Aromat kawy, smak czekolady...Gala brzydoty... Pałace pogardy... Ramiona władzy... Panteon sławy...Zapach psychozy... Pacjent otwarty... Krajobraz naczyń... Aerokształty...Zasady wojny... Angaże do armii... Grad ognia maszyn... Ameno martwymKarabiny z drewna, próchnieją w mroku starych szaf!Nikt już o nich nie pamięta... Przesiewamy przez palce czas...Karabiny z drewna, przyniosły huk żelaznych dział...Spełnia się przepowiednia... Biją w tarabany. Wróg u bram!W szkole koledzy, a po szkole za blokiem konflikt zbrojny...Już wtedy, te szczeniaki to psy wojny. Jak sobie to przypomnisz: zwolnij!Kasztany, to były granaty w kieszeniach spodni - mieliśmy siniaki od nich, ziomkiGłośniki i diody plastikowej broni, uruchamiał włącznik i prawdziwy front był!Ukryte nad butem plastikowe ostrze, wyimaginowane rany kłute...Gałąź służyła za wyrzutnię – moździerz, niszczyła z udawanym hukiemKiedy ostrzeliwaliśmy tę wioskę, w której schowany nasz wróg jest...Potem szeregowiec czekał na śmigłowiec, a kiedy lądował, każdy jak na filmach w przód biegł...Zapytaj tu Serbów i Macedończyków...Kosowian zapytaj, a nie politykówCo tu - manipuluj, a tam - modyfikuj...Obywatele mówią o ryzyku...Mówią o wyniku... Mówią o wyścigu zbrojeńMówią to, a ja się tu instynktu bojęKiedy wycieram stalowy pistolet... Ładuję naboje...Syreny zawyją, bojową godzinę... Prywatny karabin  mam i amunicjęBo kiedy tu przyjdą po moją rodzinę, wiem, że nie pomoże nam żaden oficjelNim cyjanowodoru i żelazo hemu gazami nam wypalą gardłoA rakietami pogaszą światło... Czekam jak na samozapłon!",

        "lyrics": "BASEDGOD WAS RIGHT. we’re all a bunch of golden million dollar babies. my hope is that the babies born these days will inherit less of the bullshit than we did. anyhow, what i’m about to post is for anyone who cares to read. it was intended to fill the thank you’s section in my album credits, but with all the rumors going round.. I figured it’d be good to clarify…Whoever you are. Wherever you are… I’m starting to think we’re a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness. All wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to. My loved ones are everything to me here. In the last year or 3 I’ve screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation. Mercy maybe. For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow. 4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I’d see him, and his smile. I’d hear his conversation and his silence…until it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him. By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love, it changed my life. Back then, my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with. I reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager.. The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realised they were written in a language I did not yet speak. I realised too much, too quickly. Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn’t in a plane though. I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldn’t admit the same. He had to go back inside soon, it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. He wouldn’t tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. I felt like I’d only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn’t on a cliff. I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn’t imagine keeping up my life without him. I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn’t always successfulThe dance went on.. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. It’s winter now. I’m typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat. It’s December 27, 2011. By now I’ve written two albums. This being the second. I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions. I’m surprised at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this I’d told some people my story. I’m sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans, probably angels. I don’t know what happens now, and that’s alrite. I don’t have any secrets I need kept anymore. There’s probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don’t think I ever could be. Thanks. To my first love, I’m grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn’t what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was. Some things never are.. and we were. I won’t forget you. I won’t forget the summer. I’ll remember who I was when I met you. I’ll remember who you were and how we’ve both changed and stayed the same. I’ve never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know I’m only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good. I feel like a free man. If I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too-Frank",

        "lyrics": "Seokjin30 August YEAR 22Can anyone remember the moment they fall in love? Can anyone predict the moment their love will end? What could be the reason that humans don’t have the ability to recognize those moments? And why was I given the power to return all of those things?The car came to a sudden stop, the headlights flash, crashing, bouncing, falling. I did nothing but stand defenseless in the face of all of those moments. I heard no sound and felt no sensations. It was summer, but the wind seemed cold. There was the sound of something tumbling along the street. Then there was the scent of flowers. Only then did a sense of reality come to me. The bouquet of Smeraldo flowers fell from my hand. She was laying there in the middle of the street. There was blood flowing in between the strands of her hair. The dark red blood flowers along the street. I thought, “If only I could turn back time.”Seokjin12 July YEAR 20Past the school doors, the sound of cicadas prickled my ears. The school yard was crowded with kids laughing and playing and competing in races. It was the start of summer vacation and everyone was chattering. I ducked my head and walked in between them. I wanted to leave as quickly as I could.“Hyung.” I lifted my head surprised by the sudden appearance of someone’s shoulder. It was Hoseok and Jimin. They looked at me, their smiles as wide and bright as ever and their eyes full of mischief. “Today is the start of vacation, are you still going to leave?” Hoseok asked tugging at my arm. I muttered, “sure,” and a few more meaningless words, then turned my head away. What had happened that day was clearly an accident. It wasn’t intentional. I hadn’t imagined that Jungkook and Yoongi would be in the storage room at that time. The principal suspected that I was covering for my dangsaengs. I had to say something. But in the end Yoongi had gotten expelled. Nobody knew that I had been the complicit.“Have a good vacation hyung! I’ll call you.” Maybe having interpreted my expression, Hoseok let his hand drop slightly and forced an even brighter greeting. I couldn’t answer this time either. There was nothing I could say. As I passed the school gate, I thought of the first day I had come to this school. We had all been punished  for tardiness together. We could laugh because of it. I had ruined these moments.Yoongi15 June YEAR 22I wasn't aware of anything other than the sound of music playing in my head. Not how much I had drunk, nor where I was, nor what I had been doing. I didn’t know, and it wasn’t important. When I went outside, stumbling, it was already night. I swayed as I walked. I bumped into pedestrians, news kiosks, walls. I didn’t care. I just wanted to forget everything.Jimin’s voice was still ringing in my ears. “Hyung, Jungkook…” My next memory was of running like crazy up the hospital steps. The hospital hall had been strangely long and dark. I passed people wearing hospital gowns. My heart pounded. Everyone’s faces were too pale. They had no expressions. They all seemed like dead people. The sound of my breathing was harsh inside my own head.Inside the slightly opened hospital room door, Jungkook was lying there. I turned my head without realizing it. I couldn’t look at him. At that moment I suddenly heard the sound of a piano, of flames, of a building crumbling down. I clutched my head and sank down. “This is your fault. If it wasn’t for you…” It was my mother’s voice- no my voice- no someone’s voice. At those words I was tormented by countless moments. I wanted to believe it wasn’t so. But Jungkook was lying there. Jungkook was lying in a hall full of corpse like patients passing by, I was utterly unable to go inside. I couldn’t check for myself. When I stood, my legs threatened to give out. I left with tears flowing. It was funny. I couldn’t even remember the last time I had cried.I went to cross the street, but someone grabbed my arm and I came to a halt. Who was it? No, I didn’t care. No matter who it was, it was all the same. Don’t come near me. Go away. Just leave me be. I don’t want to hurt you either. I don’t want to be hurt. So please, don’t come any closer.Yoongi12 June YEAR 19I thoughtlessly ditched school, but truthfully I didn’t have anywhere to go. It was hot. I had no money, and I had nothing to do. It was Namjoon who said we should go to the beach. The younger kids seemed excited, but I didn’t particularly feel like it, nor did I dislike the idea. “Do we have money?” At my question Namjoon made everyone shake out their pockets. A few coins, a few bills. “So we can’t go.” The one who said we could just walk was probably Taehyung. Namjoon made a face begging them to reconsider, but the kids just chattered away laughing and pretending to roll around on the road before starting to walk. I wasn’t in the mood to talk back so I just fell behind. It was midday, so even the gingko trees couldn’t provide shade, and the cars kicked up dust as they passed us on the sidewalkless road.“Let’s go there.” It was Taehyung this time too. Or was it Hoseok? I didn’t care so I didn’t look carefully, but it would have been one of them. I had been walking along with my head down, kicking dirt. When I almost collided with someone I lifted my head. Jimin was standing there as if frozen in place. The muscles in his face trembled as if had seen something terrifying. He was staring at a sign that said “Flowering Arboretum, 2.2 kilometers.\"“I didn’t want to walk.” I heard Jungkook’s voice. Sweat dripped from Jimin’s face. He went pale, as if he might collapse at any second. What is it? I had a strange feeling. “Park Jimin.” I called, but as I expected he didn’t budge. I lifted my head again and looked at the sign.“Hey, it’s so hot. Why would we go to an arboretum? Let’s go to the beach.” I said as if dragging my feet. I didn’t know what kind of place the arboretum was, but it didn’t seem like we should go. Whatever the reason, Jimin’s expression was strange. “We don’t even have money.” Hoseok replied. “That’s why we’re walking.” And Taehyung added, “If we just walk to the train station we can probably make it.” Then Namjoons said, “Instead we’ll just starve at dinner.” Jungkook and Taehyung pretended to cry, and Seokjin hyung laughed. Jimin only started to move again once it was decided that we would take the road toward the train station. Walking with his head down and his shoulders trembling, Jimin seemed like a small child. I looked up at the sign again. The characters spelling “Flowering Arboretum” were gradually getting further away.",
